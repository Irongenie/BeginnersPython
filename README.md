Developing the intuition for the basics of python

Hello community! I am new to Python and enjoying my experience so far. 
  I working on several Comptia certifications and I am about to take my CCNA exam in a few months. My ultimate goal is to be a network engineer, hopefully working on projects that are in oceanic or aerospace industries. I believe having a strong fundamental understanding of coding will help me later in my career to develop efficient and solid solutions for the problems at hand.

Fell free to contact me!
